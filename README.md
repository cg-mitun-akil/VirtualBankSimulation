# VirtualBankSimulation
I am developing a Virtual setup, the code framework was created when I was in School, currently I am developing it, finding logic loop holes.
Banking Simulation is a bit trivial, And I am using just a dat file and C++ program for it.
These are minor attempts to understand Banking setup.
My further trials in this project will be done with Database management using SQL and advanced attempts are  to
setup a Crypto and Non-fungible tokens.
Any Suggestions are welcomed. 

Date of project start : June 1 2021
